# Security Fixes

> **Last Updated: August 30, 2025**

This document summarizes the security fixes implemented in the BaseBadge codebase.

## Backend (Python)

### 1. Empty Exception Handlers

**Issue**: Several instances of `try-except-pass` patterns were detected, which could hide errors.

**Fix**: Added proper error logging to all exception handlers to ensure visibility of issues.

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/api/routes.py`
- `backend/utils/wallet.py`

### 2. Broad Exception Handling

**Issue**: Some exception handlers were too broad, potentially masking important errors.

**Fix**: Added specific exception types where possible and improved error reporting.

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/api/routes.py`
- `backend/services/scorer.py`

### 3. RPC Rate Limiting

**Issue**: No proper rate limiting for RPC calls, leading to "429 Too Many Requests" errors.

**Fix**: Implemented retry mechanism with exponential backoff using `urllib3.util.Retry`.

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/api/routes.py`

## Frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript)

### 1. Type Safety Issues

**Issue**: Several components used `any` types, reducing type safety.

**Fix**: Added proper TypeScript interfaces and types.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/app/dashboard/score-card/page.tsx`

### 2. NPM Package Vulnerabilities

**Issue**: Moderate severity Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Next.js dependency.

**Fix**: Updated Next.js to the latest version with the security patch.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/package.json`

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Comprehensive Error Logging**
   - Add structured logging throughout the application
   - Consider integrating with a monitoring service

2. **Enhance Exception Handling**
   - Further refine exception handling with specific exception types
   - Add more context to error messages

3. **Strengthen Type Safety**
   - Continue replacing `any` types with specific interfaces
   - Add more TypeScript strict checks

4. **Regular Dependency Updates**
   - Establish a regular schedule for dependency updates
   - Implement automated dependency scanning
