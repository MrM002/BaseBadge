# TODO: Advanced scoring system implementation
# This module will provide sophisticated scoring algorithms that combine
# multiple risk factors and use machine learning techniques for better accuracy
# 
# Features to implement:
# - Multi-factor risk analysis
# - Historical pattern recognition
# - Machine learning-based scoring
# - Real-time risk adjustment
